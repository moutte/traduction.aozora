This site contains Translations in French of Japanese Texts from the AOZORA BUNKO Library. Aozora Bunko is a large digital library (over 15,000 texts, more than 1,500 Japanese authors) that provides free access to Japanese literary works of the public domain. That is, texts by authors who have been deceased for more than 70 years. Rather than “definitive” translations such as those produced by professional literary translators for publishers, what you will find here are provisional translations, subject to change, made to quickly explore a fairly large number of texts by various writers representative of the different literary schools of Japan from the 1910s to the 1950s.
